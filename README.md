# Belko PSD Rebuild – Frontend Progress

This project is a hand-coded rebuild of the Belko Auto Body PSD design, focusing on responsive layout, accurate visual replication, and clean frontend architecture.

## What’s Done So Far
- Full hero section rebuilt (title layout, dots, responsive line breaking)
- Spinning circular badge and button CTA alignment
- Responsive breakpoints created (1400, 1050, 950, 900, 825, 775)
- Location & Reviews vertical tab with hover styling
- Header layout refinements and element visibility rules on smaller screens
- Mobile menu button (hamburger to animated X)
- Sliding modal navigation panel with proper z-index layering
- Initial JavaScript for modal open/close logic

## Tech Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (flexbox, responsive media queries)  
- Vanilla JavaScript  
- Google Fonts: *Poppins*
- Chrome DevTools

## Next Steps
- Begin building additional page sections or a bonus subpage once the hero and nav are fully locked in
- Incorporate some grid layout work to show variety in structure
- Embed placeholder drone video to amplify section/subpage

## Notes
_This repository is being updated frequently as the layout gets dialed in for pixel accuracy and responsiveness._
